# Exercise 2.3

Rewrite `popcount` to use a loop instead of a single expression. Compare the performance of the two versions. (Section 11.4 shows hwo to compare the performance of different implementations systematically.

## Benchmark Results

```

```

The expression-based version is about 3 times faster than the loop version.
